# Useless is not worthless ðŸš€

Most of my projects are open source and free to use. Some of these don't
have any other purpose than exploration and experimenting.

<h4>Discriminatory Network</h4>

A social network built from the ground up against discrimination. I used AWS EC2, NodeJS, MongoDB, Joi, Redis, and GraphQL on the backend. On the frontend I used React, Urql, Gatsby, Cypress, Sass, and Webpack. I coupled this stack with Firebase Authentication and the project was built in less than 2 months. I designed the whole design system for this project, used Trello to manage it as well as GitHub to host and update the code. I also had TravisCI setup for the frontend CI/CD coupled with Jest and ESLint to make sure new code 'just works' and follows the standards I set.

This was my proudest accomplishment, although test coverage was not near as good as I wanted, but I had 2 months to build it anyway. Sadly it didn't make it to production because it costs a lot for a student like myself. ðŸ˜…

	<h4>My Blog</h4>
</a>

This very website. Built with GatsbyJS, React, and Sass. I don't have much to say about it except that I designed and developed it all from the ground up, and maintain it from time to time. Oh, I hooked it up to NetlifyCMS recently too! A much better blogging workflow if you ask me. ðŸ˜„
