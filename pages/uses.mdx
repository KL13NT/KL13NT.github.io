# Development Environment

This is my development environment setup. Tools I use to be productive, all around.

#### Editor + Terminal üë®‚Äçüíª

- [Visual Studio Code] is my current editor. I switched to it back in 2018.
- I'm using [Shades of Purple] as my main theme and sometimes switch to [GitHub Light]. My favourite fonts are Space Mono and FiraCode, currently using the former.
- Firefox is my main, and I use Chrome for testing sometimes.
- [Cmder] is my terminal of choice with custom theme and [integrations].

#### Productivity üí™

- [Notion] is my main editorial app. Blog post drafts, to-do, and channel-related stuff.
- [Trello] for project management.
- As for time-tracking, I use a tool that I built myself called [AuditMyDay].

Anything else? Probably have a bash/node script for it.

#### Recording + Editing üìπ

- OBS to record any and all videos.
- Audacity for audio-related stuff, recorded podcasts, etc.
- Vegas Pro 17 is my main video editing software.
- Kdenlive sometimes.
- Figma as my main website prototype design tool.

# Work and Experiments
