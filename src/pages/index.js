				<p>
					My name is Nabil Tharwat. I'm a software engineer, content creator, and mentor. I was born and raised in Cairo with a passion for computers. I started coding when I was 12 with VB, now living in JS land. I love contributing to open source. Accessibility and performance are part of my eternal quest.
				</p>

You can also find me on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/i-am-nabil'>LinkedIn</a>, <a href='https://github.com/KL13NT'>GitHub</a>, and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdGKzbiQkePzSqFf7HBrSPg'>YouTube</a>. My resume can be downloaded in PDF <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/export?format=pdf&amp;id=1VL4_iTKO712R-H7S5_3_PkuG1ed97eoIJUMjo9T9noE'>here</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I'm not coding some frontend stuff I'm usually found experimenting, mentoring people new to the field, trying out new utilities on the market, blogging, making videos and devlogs, or contributing to Valarium.
				</p>

				<p>
					2019 was a busy year for a freshman student in which I participated in Hacktoberfest, founded <a href='https://valarium.netlify.app'>Valarium</a>, scored first place on TheNetNinja's February Code <a href='https://kl13nt.github.io/Clock-Animated/'>Challenge</a>, and created a simple C++ introductory text <a href='https://github.com/KL13NT/cppbasics'>course</a> for college students.
				</p>

				<p>
					By mid-2020 I managed to collect all four frontend-related FreeCodeCamp certificates, published my first <a href='https://github.com/KL13NT/discord-utils'>npm package</a>, hosted 4 online <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLVZR2VAHRwGGihgl7StmuS6DdvPXbfoV'>sessions</a>, and started learning Russian.
				</p>

				<p>
					I love environments that help me grow. Team members who know how to communicate their thoughts well are appreciated. I love making a difference with my code.
