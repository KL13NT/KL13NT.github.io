Back in 2019 I participated in Hacktoberfest and completed the challenge. This year I'm planning on doing it again, only with a slight twist. 

This year I'll also start a #30DaysOfCode challenge with my friends at [Valarium](https://valarium.netlify.app/blog/30-days-of-code-challenge). During the next 30 days I'll create a devlog documenting me either working on PRs for the Hacktoberfest challenge or building minimal websites for the world to see inspired by Dribbble artists. 

Join me! I'll be posting my progress on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdGKzbiQkePzSqFf7HBrSPg) and Valarium! 

There will also be a GitHub repo with all the code just in case someone would like to PR on one of them as part of Hacktoberfest or OSS contribution in general!
