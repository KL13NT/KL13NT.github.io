Palestinians are living buried under siege. Gaza is suffering one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. An open-air prison, this is Gaza in numbers.

_This is originally a Twitter [thread][thread] on my profile._

_If you don't know what's going on in Palestine, I recommend [these][documentaries] documentaries._

- The Gaza strip is only 25 miles long, and 5 miles wide. 2 million Palestinians live in this tiny space. Half are children.
- Many live in refugee camp that the Israeli forces bomb from time to time.
- 80% of the population relies on foreign aid. 
- Gaza has only two exits, one through the Israeli "borders", and the Egyptian borders. What Israel calls a border is a heavily militarised fence comprised of barbed wires, surveillance networks, and no-go lethal zones. 
- If you roam too close to the no-go zone, about 350 meters out from the fence, Israeli forces are authorised to shoot-to-kill. Thousands of unarmed Palestinians have been shot in 2018 for violating this "rule". Half are children, paramedics, disabled, and press reporters. 
- Refugees in other countries may be able to flee by sea, but Gaza's coast is also a no-go zone controlled by Israel. Fishermen are restricted to only a few nautical miles from the shore. Strain past that and you'll be blown out of the water by Israeli war ships. 
- Gaza has the highest youth unemployment rate in the world. 70% of the Youth are unemployed, with 52% for the general population.
- Gas is expensive and largely unavailable. Palestinians have to come up with clever ways just to cook. 
- The siege put most farms out of business.
- This food insecurity is a purposeful effect of the blockade. Israel controls the amount of food that enters Gaza based on the very minimum caloric intake needed to avoid malnutrition. Officials call it "putting Gaza on a diet". 
- 97% of fresh water in Gaza is toxic.
- The vast majority of Gaza's water desalination plants which produces fresh, drinkable water have been completely flattened or damaged by Israeli bombs.
- Fixing them requires importing materials banned by the blockade. 
- Over 25% of diseases in Gaza are caused by completely contaminated water.
- Water can't be pumped to roof tanks without electricity, which is cut off 20 hours a day, only on for four hours a day, causing food to spoil in fridges and water to become more scarce. 
- Their sick are trapped and sentenced to a slow and painful end. In order to exit the Gaza strip you must obtain a permit from Israeli authorities. They're rarely approved.
- Breast Cancer survival rate in Israel is 86%, while in Gaza it plummets below 30%. 
- The percentage of medical travel permits approved in 2012 was 93%. In 2014, the number dropped to 82%, 62% in 2016, 54% in 2017.
- WHO reported that 54 Palestinians, 46 of whom had cancer, died in 2017 following denial or delay of their permits. 
- WHO reported that Palestinians from Gaza missed at least 11,000 scheduled medical appointments in 2017 after Israeli authorities denied or failed to respond in time to applications for permits. 


And on top of all that, Israel considers every woman, child, and elder in Gaza aa threat. They're all labelled "terrorist" by the Israeli government, and they use this excuse to bomb civilian buildings and governmental services such as hospitals, schools, refugee camps, and roads.
