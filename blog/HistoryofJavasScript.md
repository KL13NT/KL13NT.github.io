JavaScript appeared in late 90's after Java had started to gain attraction in the market. Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape (the company responsible for the powerful Firefox browser) to develop a language to be used in their browser as a scripting language to allow developers to manipulate the page as they see fit.

## A brief history

JavaScript appeared in late 90's after Java had started to gain attraction in the market. Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape (the company responsible for the powerful Firefox browser) to develop a language to be used in their browser as a scripting language to allow developers to manipulate the page as they see fit. The language was developed in just about 6 months (you'll hear 3 weeks but that's the time it took Brendan Eich to write the first spec), and was called LiveScript. It was something used to face Java in the market as other companies started suggesting making Java the defacto of the web platform, little did they know. Quite some time later the language was renamed to JavaScript to gain more attraction in the market. It gained a lot of attention and by that time it was handed to ECMA International to stop Microsoft from taking contol over the language, standardise it, and to maintain and develop it. It was assigned the name EcmaScript (abbreviated ES) and was given codename "ECMA-262".

The second version was released with tiny bits of optimisations and a some new features. Then came the third version, EcmaScript 3, followed by the development of the fourth version that didn't make it to production and instead was merged into the fifth version, "ES5" which had changed the whole ecosystem by the time it arrived. It brought countless new features and optimisations that made it even more inviting and easy to use. Then in 2009 came NodeJS, the JavaScript runtime that allowed us to craft server-side applications using JavaScript outside of Microsoft server environments, and many libraries were on the market including jQuery. The sixth version of EcmaScript was inspired by a lot of those libraries and came calling for innovation in 2015, rendering many of those libraries useless as the functions shipped in those libraries have become built into the language itself.

## EcmaScript, JavaScript, what's the difference?

EcmaScript as I have pointed out previously is the standard produced by ECMA International. JavaScript on the other hand is the implementation of that standard, and we all know that different browsers support different features, which is their own implementation of the standard.

To highlight some of the main differences between them, if you look at the spec, you won't find any timing functions, so setInterval, setTimeout, etc. are not actually in the standard but rather the browsers' implementations.

## TL;DR

EcmaScript is a standard maintained by Ecma International. JavaScript is the browser implementations that conform to that standard.
